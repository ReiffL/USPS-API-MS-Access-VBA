Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) sample code to check addresses using the United States Postal Service (USPS) application programming interface (API). This was done in MS Access, but would likely work in Excel with slight modifications.

Free for anyone to use in any way they see fit. I was surprised that there were not more code samples for this API, and various AI systems got confused between the old USPS web interface (shutting down in 2025) and the new USPS oAuth API.

This example is just for address verification, but the same structure would likely work with other USPS APIs.
